# LiteDenseNet
**Abstract:**Hyperspectral Image (HSI) classification based on deep learning is an attractive area in recent years. However, as a data-driven algorithm, deep learning methods usually require numerous computational resources and high-quality labelled dataset, while the cost of high-performance computing and data annotation is expensive. In this paper, to reduce dependence on massive calculation and labelled samples, we propose a lightweight network architecture for Hyperspectral Image Classification (LiteDenseNet). Based on DenseNet and inspired by GoogLeNet and PeleeNet, we design a 3D two-way dense layer to capture the local and global features of input, and harness group convolution to decrease parameters further, which enable LiteDenseNet owns simpler architecture and higher efficiency. Thus, the number of parameters and the consumptions of calculation are observably less than contrapositive deep learning methods. A series of experiences on 6 widely used hyperspectral datasets show that the proposed LiteDenseNet obtain the state-of-the-art performance, even though when the absence of labelled samples is severe.
